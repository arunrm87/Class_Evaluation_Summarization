How does dislocation affect Thermal & Electrical conductivity
What is Cold Working, % Cw calculation, how to read its graphs,  why ductility reduces by CW, CW vs hot work, CW vs Grain size reduction
Grain Size Reduction understanding, hall-Petch equation, Anealing relation to dislocation and grain size, recrystallization, properties of metals after grain growth
First activity, difference between deformation processing (Rolling, drawing, extrusion, etc)
Final activity (Effect of CW, Annealing, grain size on Mechanical & other prop.)
Why the strengthening occurs based on cold working or hot working
Why does lead allow for hot working at such a low temp?
Different strengthen mechanism
