Group discussion helps a lot (including: explaining to others, learning from classmates or TAs)
Activities are very helpful (Including: activities with the graphs, doing it first by myself then within a group)
Visually
Graphs and pictures help if: they are explained, they are well labled
Seeing more applications and real life examples
HW preview problem and redoing it at the class
Phoenix to Tucson example helped
New Concepts
Don't like the preview problem of the HW
