Real examples of failures and why they happened (mostly airplane crash was mentioned)
Different types of failures
Brittle vs Ductil fractions
Types of fatigue behaivior (Fatigue limit)
Stell vs cast iron (brooklyn bridge)
Tensile test
Influence of Temperature on impac Energy
Rlationship between  fractures/ cracks and the crack length/ crack radius
